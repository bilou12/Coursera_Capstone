# Introduction / Business problem

When it comes to invest in real-estate, the investors say there are 3 rules: location, location and location.

Every investor need to get the right location to get a good return on investment.

The location is important because:
- it can not be changed over time contrarily to the house itself which can be renovated
- it determines the supply and demand
- it helps to define the best renting strategy (long-term vs short-term)

All this combined influences the return on investment of the investor.

We will in this project focus on the investor who is willing to rent a place for short-term let as this is a growing 
market.

# Data

Investors who want to buy a house to rent with short-term let should consider:
- supply and demand rentals --> this data can be acquired from Airbnb
- the rate per night --> available with the Airbnb API
- the area with the most venues around --> available from the Foursquare API
